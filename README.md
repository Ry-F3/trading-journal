### **Bringing Traders Together: A Common Ground in Recording**
Regardless of their specific trading style—be it day trading, swing trading, position trading, or any other approach—serious traders share a common need: the ability to meticulously record and analyse their trades. Many exchanges have limitations on data retention, often erasing valuable trading history after a certain period.

Trade Tribe unifies this diverse community by providing a secure and reliable platform for traders to log their transactions comprehensively. Whether a day trader chasing intraday opportunities or a position trader taking a long-term investment approach, every trader benefits from a central repository that safeguards their trading data.
By offering categorization and filtering tools, Trade Tribe ensures that traders can effortlessly navigate through their trade history. This not only aids in performance analysis but also fosters a sense of confidence, knowing that their trading journey is documented and accessible whenever needed.

In essence, while trading styles and preferences may vary, the commitment to professional and meticulous record-keeping is the common thread that binds traders together within the Trade Tribe community.

* User ID = A has rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
* User ID = B has rows [1, 2, 3, 4]
* User ID = C has rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

This dynamic row structure ensures a personalised and organized record-keeping system for each user, facilitating easy management and retrieval of trade information, without database conflictions.
